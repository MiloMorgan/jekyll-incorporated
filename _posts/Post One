# First Post: An Intro
Hello my name is Miles Morgan, I am currently a senior attending the University of Mississippi. I am a double major in Political Science and Criminal Justice, with a minor in Professional Writing. I have lived in Oxford for twelve years but I am originally from New Orleans, having evacuated here during hurricane Katrina, I have a twin brother that is currently serving in the Air Force and a mother that works in St. Thomas, USVI with the blind and visually impaired. Interests include reading, writing, weightlifting, and travelling (been to three different countries so far: Australia, Brasil, and Mexio). I really want to see about getting a cat and a dog this year?

## Why Professional Writing 
I chose professional writing because it directly ties into what I want to do as a career: research. I hope the minor will help me develop a "professional voice", so to speak, in the articles I plan to publish one day. I also chose this minor to give me not only more experience writing but also a more rigorous one than what my other majors may offer, which will help my technical skills, staying on schedule, and bettering my writing overall. The classes in the minor have also allowed me some freedom in choosing what I want to write about, something not offered in my Poli sci and CJ classes.
